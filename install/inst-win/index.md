# ID Bridge Install on Windows

The Identity Bridge for Active Directory Configuration application can be installed on Windows servers based on the specifications outlined on in the [System Requirements](../../install/index.md#windows__amp__active_directory_requirements) section.

If you are co-hosting Thycotic products like Privilege Manager and installing the Identity Bridge Configuration application on an existing server already running Internet Information Services, the application pool identity might need to be reset to the correct account permissions, if the Active Directory Domain Server is added or created after the application pools for Privilege Manager have been established.
