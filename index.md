# Thycotic Identity Bridge

Thycotic's __Identity Bridge__ (ID Bridge) is a utility that allows the setting of values to be used in the Thycotic panels under Active Directory User and Computers, User and Group Properties. These values are used to enable the ID Bridge to manage the user authentication from Linux\Unix hosts to Active directory.

The ID Bridge Configuration Utility allows to globally set all values and selected values at an organizational unit (OU) level.

Below are all panels that appear under the ID Bridge Configuration Utility, each page outlines the functionality of the Panel

## General

Default settings of values for User and Group attributes, including starting Idâ€™s, default home and shell parameters.

## Authentication

Defines ACL and User attribute requirements for authenticating against the Active Directory. Setting of Home directory permissions and syncing of local Linux\Unix passwords with Active Directory.

## Password Prompts

Defines the Password prompt text the user will see for different access types on the Linux\Unix host.

## Attribute Mapping

Allow Active directory values to be mapped to Thycotic ID Bridge fields. For example based on AD terms, Display Name is mapped to Unix Username.

## Cache Settings

Sets the amount of time the local Linux\Unix agent will store a copy of the users password within the agent. This is required in the event the Agent is unable to contact AD to verify the users credentials.
