# Thycotic Identity Bridge

Thycotic's __Identity Bridge__ (ID Bridge) is a utility that allows the setting of values to be used in the Thycotic panels under Active Directory User and Computers, User and Group Properties. These values are used to enable the ID Bridge to manage the user authentication from Linux\Unix hosts to Active directory.

The ID Bridge Configuration Utility allows to globally set all values and selected values at an organizational unit (OU) level.
