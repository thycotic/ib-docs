# Thycotic Overrides

The Thycotic Overrides panel under OU properties of ADUC allows you to override some of the POSIX user fields normally set Globally in the Thycotic Configuration Utility or Individually under ADUC User Properties.

These will then be used as the default values for any users created under that OU.

When using the global configuration a banner will be displayed.
