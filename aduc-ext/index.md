# ADUC Extension

The ID Bridge Extension provides a Thycotic Panel in both the User and Group Property modals of the  Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) MMC.

The Thycotic extension panel can accept settings from the ID Bridge Configuration Utility allowing certain fields to be pre-populated, although there is no dependency between the Utility and the Extension.

From the Thycotic panel you can manage fields independently as well as generate UID and GID values for users and groups respectively.

* Users - Thycotic Panel
  * Panel that allows you to manage the ID Bridge values on an individual user basis
  * This includes UID Number, primary group membership and additional Linux\Unix user attributes
* Groups - Thycotic Panel
  * Panel that allows you to manage the ID Bridge values on an individual group basis
  * This includes GID Number, Description and additional Linux\Unix group attributes
